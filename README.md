A simple WebScraper made using Java Jsoup Library.
It brings out the programs required by the students directy to the console.
Approach for the scraper assumes that the first link appearing on a google search for the program
will be that of geeks for geeks. And then Scrapes the pre tags present on the first URL.
A careful observation reveals that Geeksforgeeks has all it's programs stored in between the pre tags
which makes it easier to Scrape.

Need to see if the stuff works still. Now geeks for geeks store all the codes inside the class named = "code". So I doubt the implementation of the given stuff will work now. This was implemented approximately 2 years back.
